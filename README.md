# LotW-Randomizer
Game Randomizer for Legacy of the Wizard

Thank you for taking the interest in viewing the Legacy of the Wizard randomizer. The code is written in vb.net so there may possibly be some issues with compatibility on the .NET Framework

Here is what the Randomizer currently does:

1. Randomize Treasure Contents
By having this selected, all treasures in the game (with the exception of Crown and Dragon Slayer spots) will have their contents changed to a random item. Each chest can be any item in the game, including Rings, Crosses, Shields, and even POISON. It is also possibly to get multiple of a certain item, all depending on what the RNG gives. I might at some point make an option to keep the original chest contents but shuffle them around (for those who like to have 20+ chests of bread), but for now this will do.

2. Randomize Character Stats
By having this selected, all 5 characters will have random Jump, Power, and Distance stats. Jump should be anywhere between 18 and 26, Strength anywhere between 1 and 3, and Distance anywhere between 8 and 32. 

3. Overwrite game files
Unfortunately, this current build will overwrite the Rom file that you select. There is a mention of this on the program, so make sure that you are using a copy of the file as to not ruin your original copy. This will be fixed ASAP.

The code currently does what it is intended to do, but there still may be some cases of very difficult or even unwinnable games. These will be (hopefully) be fixed in time.

Here is what I hope to do in future releases:

1. Randomize Shop Inventory & Prices
This could add quite a bit of difficulty to the game, so the intention is to also have the "Home" shop contain a Glove/Mattock and the Wings, two important items to advance in the game. 

2. Randomize Dungeon Music
Having this option would be cool, especially since there is an unreleased track that is pretty cool to listen to. 

3. Randomize or have selectable pallette changes.
Nothing big, but something that could be fun for a change.

4. Randomize chest locations
There are 64 chests in the game, one per scene. Currently, they are all in the same spot, but it is possible to move them to a different spot within the scene. I would probably limit to some certain spots since we don't want them stuck in a wall or anything like that.

5. "Normalize" character stats
Whereas randomizing character stats is already done, "Normalizing" stats would make each character have the same stats (either fixed or random) so that you have to choose a character based on his/her own item usage. Would possibly add a bit more of a challenge.

6. Randomize character item usage (still looking into)
I believe I have seen data on this but until I test it I am unsure, but if possible, I would love to be able to change what character can use what item. Imagine Xemn using the Wings or Pochi using the DragonSlayer. Would make things different, but certain item sets would have to be the or close. For instance, the Wings would have to be on a character that can use a Key Stick and either Crossbow or Mattock just to be able to get through Meyna's Level. Consumables (Elixir, Crystal, etc) would still be used by all

7. Give option for MSX2 Layout
The MSX2 version of the game offers quite a few differences from the NES version in terms of layout. If you have ever played either, you will notice that Lyll's level is VERY much different between versions. 

8. Eliminate shortcuts
I could possibly give an option for a player to give themselves a challenge by cutting off certain shortcuts (like in Lyll's level which is possible to skip most of it just by using the Pause-jump glitch). May or may not try this.

9. Randomize Dungeon layouts
This would be the ultimate goal of the randomizer. Currently, it is beyond my knowledge on how to make the layout random without making an absolute mess, but this still would be the best thing I could hope for in the randomizer. 

10. Randomize which enemies appear in which scene
It is possible to change enemy groups in each area. Doing so, it is possible to have the strong enemies from Pochi's dungeon in the very first scene. Could make certain parts of the game more difficult than need be, but who doesn't like a challenge?

11. Give option to shuffle vanilla chest contents
This would basically keep what the chests contain but just shuffle where they are around. There would still be 26 chests with bread and every item would only have 1 spot in the dungeon where it could possibly be (except Spike Shoes since there are two of them in the dungeon). 

12. Randomize Crown Locations
It is easy enough to do, but it would be interesting to place the Crowns in different spots in the dungeon. It is possible to even put all four in one particular area, which while fun could be a challenge.

13. Randomize Dragonslayer Location
This would be an option, but would make the game very easy as you could finish the game as soon as you find it without having to do all the crowns (unless the Dragonslayer was still in its original spot).

14. Randomize Portrait teleports
I am not sure if this is possible at all, but it would be interesting if the program could make the portrait warps take you somewhere else. It would give quite a bit of a challenge, especially for those familiar with the game already.

-None yet-

Special Thanks goes to deranged_squirrel_fighter and DragonarchSDA for offering to test and play the randomizer. 

Special thanks to Serria for putting up with me banging my head against my computer trying to figure out how to get a program to do what I want it to.
